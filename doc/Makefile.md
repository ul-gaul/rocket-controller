# Makefile

This file is intended to be a quick reference for this project's Makefile,
as well as giving a little explanation of what a Makefile is, how they work
and why we are using them.

This document is intended for engineering freshmen. For the more curious among
the readers, I strongly suggest reading the make
[documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) from the
GNU project.


## What is a Makefile?

A Makefile is a set of instruction for the compiler. It
details the steps that produce the project's executable binary. This
is probably overwhelming, so let's try with an analogy.

The code you want the processor to run is called a binary. Let's say this
binary is a delicious [brownie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixe_NYTSFwo):

- You can eat the brownie, just like the CPU can run a binary.
- You cannot (well, should not) eat raw eggs, flour, cacao powder, sugar and melted butter, just like the CPU cannot run the source code directly.
